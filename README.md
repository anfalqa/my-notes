I learned after reading the resource a lot of things

1. its imortant to understand the purpose of the software to help people.
1. if you dont understand the purpose of the software will write bad software.
1. Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others and can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers.
1. the difference between a bad developer and agood developer is the underdstanding, the bad developer don’t understand what they are doing, and good developers do.
1. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, the good developer looking for simplicity so that  it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs and make other developers understand and be happy.
1. There will always be some implementation of changes. Not only you have to implement them, but you also have to maintain them over time,
the Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development.
1. All changes require maintenance.
1. Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.
1. there are three important factors that will help you make a better decision and making Prioritizing.
    1. The desirability of a change (D): How much do you want that change to happen?
    1. The value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
    1. The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?
1. When you prioritize your work, you should follow this rule:
The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.
1. Start small, improve it, then extend. don't search for perfect, good enough is fine.
1. Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks,If you can automate it, automate it.
1. The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read. that mean big code does not mean  doing a great job.
1. *“One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.”* — Ken Thompson
1. everyone should know that your code is tested, and works.
1. Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.
1. Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development.
